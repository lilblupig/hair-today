## UX

### **Overview and Broad Design Choices**
Our imaginary hairdresser is unisex, and provides niche services such as curly cuts and beard so neutral greys were chosen along with a bright yellow to give a punchy, modern look (mostly from Bootstrap base palette to keep design simple as the focus is on learning to use PHP and SQL).

## Features

### **Existing Features**
Features common to all pages/sections:
* Single page design which populates with dynamic content from the database.
* Responsive design for all device sizes.
* Large image to elicit positive emotional response.
* Mirrored header and footer for intuitive use.

### **Features for Future Implementation**
1. Further dynamic content | To increase user familiarity with staff and services and therefore encourage bookings.
1. Activate email contact | To allow prospective customers to get in touch
1. Online booking system | To allow customers to select the service they want, the stylist and an available time slot.
